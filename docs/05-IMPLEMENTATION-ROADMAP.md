# ChecklistApp - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the implementation plan for ChecklistApp, focusing on delivering the **5 CORE PRIORITY FEATURES** first, before any other functionality.

## 🎯 Core Implementation Priority (MUST BE COMPLETED FIRST)

These five features are **MANDATORY PRIORITY 1** - all must be implemented before any other features:

1. **Template-Based Generation (MVP)**: Quick checklist creation from industry templates
2. **Interactive Customization**: Guided Q&A for tailored checklists
3. **AI-Powered Intelligence**: Claude API for photo-based generation
4. **Professional Export**: PerfexCRM GraphQL export
5. **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: No other features should be started until these 5 core features are fully functional. This is the primary implementation directive.
