## Implementation Checklist

### Before Starting ANY Development
- [ ] Confirm all 5 priority features are understood
- [ ] Review technical requirements for each feature
- [ ] Set up Claude API access
- [ ] Configure PerfexCRM GraphQL credentials
- [ ] Establish mobile-first design system

### During Development
- [ ] Focus ONLY on the 5 priority features
- [ ] Reject scope creep for non-priority features
- [ ] Test all features work together
- [ ] Maintain mobile responsiveness throughout
- [ ] Document API integrations

### Definition of "Complete"
Each feature is considered complete when:
- ✅ Fully functional with no critical bugs
- ✅ Integrated with other priority features
- ✅ Tested on multiple devices
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Ready for production use

## Document References

All project documentation has been updated to reflect these priorities:

1. **[README.md](../README.md)** - Updated with priority features section
2. **[01-PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md](01-PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md)** - Revised phases to prioritize core features
3. **[03-API-DESIGN.md](03-API-DESIGN.md)** - APIs reorganized for priority features
4. **[04-TECHNOLOGY-STACK.md](04-TECHNOLOGY-STACK.md)** - Tech stack aligned with priorities
5. **[05-IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md](05-IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md)** - Timeline revised for core features first

## Enforcement Guidelines

### For Project Managers
- Review daily progress against 5 priority features
- Block any work on non-priority features
- Escalate if priority features are delayed
- Ensure resources focus on priorities

### For Developers
- Implement priority features in order
- Do not start non-priority work
- Report blockers immediately
- Test integration between features

### For Stakeholders
- Expect priority features first
- Defer requests for other features
- Support focus on core priorities
- Validate features meet requirements

---

**Remember**: No other features should be started until ALL 5 core priority features are fully functional and integrated. This ensures the product delivers complete value from the first release.
